SimilarTool
===========

Tool to perform three-way classification of melodies according to similarity and contrast criteria.

Software developed in support of my [PhD thesis](http://oro.open.ac.uk/45474/).

This was part of the third study included in the thesis, and used in conjunction with [this other tool](https://github.com/Morpheu5/ThirdStudy).
